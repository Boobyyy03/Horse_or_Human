# CNN Model Overview

## Overview
This Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model is developed for classifying images into two categories: horses and humans. It utilizes convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers to extract relevant features from image data and perform classification.

## Operation Process
The operation process of the model involves:

### Convolutional Layers:
These layers learn specific filters to identify particular features in images.

### Pooling Layers:
This layer reduces the dimensionality of the data and extracts important information from the learned features.

### Fully Connected Layers:
These layers amalgamate the learned features to execute classification.

## Training Process
The training process involves training the model with accurately labeled training data to adjust its parameters through the backpropagation algorithm. Tuning hyperparameters like filter size, number of layers, learning rate, and dropout rate is crucial for achieving optimal performance on the test dataset.

## Summary
In summary, this CNN model serves as a robust framework for understanding the workings of CNNs in image classification tasks, starting from recognizing elementary features to the final classification process. It facilitates a comprehension of fundamental concepts in deep learning and image processing.
